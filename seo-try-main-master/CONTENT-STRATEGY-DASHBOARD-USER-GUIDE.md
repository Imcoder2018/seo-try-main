## Section 1: Overview Tab

### Purpose

The Overview tab provides a high-level summary of your content strategy, including your target audience persona, key metrics, and top keywords.

### Key Components

#### 1.1 Target Persona Card (Sticky Sidebar)

**What It Shows:**
- **Audience**: Who your content is actually targeting
- **Tone**: The writing style and voice of your content
- **Writing Tip**: Guidance on how to use this persona

**How to Use It:**

1. **Review Your Audience**
   - Check if the identified audience matches your intended target
   - If not, adjust your content strategy to align with your goals
   - Example: If it says "Technical Decision Makers" but you want "Small Business Owners," you need to rewrite your content

2. **Understand Your Tone**
   - Note the tone description (e.g., "Professional, Technical")
   - Ensure all new content matches this tone for consistency
   - If you want to change your tone, plan a content refresh

3. **Follow the Writing Tip**
   - Use the persona as a guide for all content creation
   - Every piece should speak directly to this audience
   - Maintain the identified tone throughout

**Example Scenario:**
```
Your Persona Card shows:
- Audience: "Technical Decision Makers & Healthcare Administrators"
- Tone: "Professional, Technical, Authority-focused"

Action: When writing new blog posts, assume you're speaking to CTOs and hospital administrators. Use technical language appropriately, cite data and research, and maintain a professional, authoritative voice.
